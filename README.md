# TODO-LIST-App

This project is developed on Node.js, HTML5, CSS3 and mongodb for database storage.
The user can add or delete tasks in/ from the list and color-schemes make this app a more user interactable.

Click on Add Task and Delete Task Button to see hover effects and successfully configure the task required to be accomplished.
Each task has a description, Category that needs to be chosen from the drop down menu and a date at which this task needs to be done.

Toggle Button is there for day and night effcts and background animation makes it more interactable and robust.
